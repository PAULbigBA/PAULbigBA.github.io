                    <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Professional Journey</h3>
                    <p>My fascination with the world of computers began at a young age, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science starting in 2019. I'll readily admit that mastering computer science didn't come easily to me, but I refused to give up. I actively sought out challenging courses, embracing the difficulty even it make me feel painful.</p>
                    <p>Due to the pandemic, it wasn't until my junior year that I landed my first professional role: an on-call IT support position. My responsibilities centered on maintaining the entire network infrastructure for a clinic, including managing network devices like printers and laptops.
                        Building on this experience, I soon secured my second opportunity: returning to China to join a small startup as an R&D Engineer. In this role, I developed embedded software programs for microcontrollers. It was incredibly rewarding to apply the C programming language skills I'd learned in university to real-world projects.</p>
                    <p>After completing this four-month internship, I returned to university. There, I encountered more advanced coursework, frequently involving semester-long (four-month) project development cycles. I thoroughly enjoyed these academic projects; they not only provided valuable hands-on experience but also deepened my skills in collaborative team environments. </p>
                    <p>Following my graduation, I joined my current company, PetoKingdom. Here, I work as a Frontend Developer, focusing on core coding tasks. Starting from a blank slate, my colleagues and I collaborated closely to build our systems from the ground up. We methodically developed the frontend architecture, progressing from simple beginnings to increasingly complex functionality, steadily constructing this digital foundation piece by piece.</p>
                    <p>Concurrently, I've maintained and expanded my backend knowledge. I participated in the GenAI-2025 project with my friends and I contributed to our project as a backend developer, gaining firsthand experience with the power of AI. I witnessed how AI significantly boosts efficiency and simplifies the learning process. Rather than feeling threatened by AI's rise, I approach it as I would any past challenge: I'm eager to take on the challenge and leverage it to explore wider and deeper paths in my career journey, knowing that beautiful scenery lies beyond.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Development Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time. My principles: simplicity, efficiency, and user-centric design. I'm a strong advocate for test-driven development and continuous integration, ensuring that every line of code I write is robust and reliable.</p>
                    <p>In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, I'm committed to continuous learning. I actively explore emerging technologies like AI/ML integration in web development and stay current with industry best practices. This allows me to bring innovative solutions to complex problems and deliver cutting-edge applications.</p>
